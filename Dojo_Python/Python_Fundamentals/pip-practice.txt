pip practice

1. uses pip to install Django on the machine

2. lists installed packages in pippi

3. returns the message “Requirement already satisfied: Django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages” because the package was already installed

4. ‘list’ tells the user the installed packages. ‘freeze’ says the installed packages in requirements format that is usable in another environment

5. this command creates a text file that includes a list of installed packages and their version requirements. The file is created on the Desktop, since that is where the user navigated to.

6. uninstalls Django from the machine

7. nothing happens because Django is removed from the machine, so there is nothing to show

8. searches python pip packages and returns all results containing the search term, in this case “flask”
