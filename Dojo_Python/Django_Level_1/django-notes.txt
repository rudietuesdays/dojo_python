DJANGO
django-admin startproject <project_name>
mkdir apps
touch __init__.py


- django-admin in only for *starting* project, after that use manage.py
- manage.py is script that allows u to run commands (like starting server
- django creates project settings for you
- ~views~ are controllers, ~templates~ are views
- create templates folder as usual
- also create templates/<login> or /<logout> etc
- create templates folder for each app, put @app name inside templates
	- same w static folders

document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].playbackRate = 1.5

hash pw password = "the most secret password ever"
Qs: having multiple apps? how it affects DB?

***BELT EXAM TIPS***
mind folder names when deploying in django
use templates!! esp loginReg BUT start apps from scratch and copy/past code
heavily comment!!
use resources
be judicious in copy-paste — do it in small chunks to make it easier
be comfortable with pip install
don’t stressssss
20 min rule! don’t get stuck on specific feature, move on and come back if u need
4 hours is a long, take a break!
in case of fire: git add, git commit, git push, then leave
